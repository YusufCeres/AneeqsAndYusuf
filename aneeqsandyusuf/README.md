This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## About 
This project is being built for me and my significant other. The goal is to create a platform where we can chat with each other, track each other, and maintain a shared gallery.
## Deployment plan

The plan is to eventually deploy it using vercel.

## Current progress
Implemented the login and signup pages
